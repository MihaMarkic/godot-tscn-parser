The project is an [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) based parser for Godot's [TSCN files](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/file_formats/tscn.html).
The short term goal is to provide support for source code generators and not for full fledged parsing as TSCN files are not very well documented.
